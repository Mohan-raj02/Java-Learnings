//abstract class

//        Any subclass must implement (override) all abstract methods, unless the subclass is also abstract.
//        Abstract classes can have constructors, but you cannot instantiate them directly.          Animal a = new Animal(); // ❌ Error
//        Abstract methods have nothing to do with constructors.
//        Constructors are for initializing fields, and abstract classes often have fields to initialize.
//        Abstract classes define a “contract” through abstract methods.
//        Dynamic dispatch ensures the correct overridden method is called at runtime.

// example syntax: abstract void career (String name);
// Abstract methods → methods without a body (only declared, no code).
// any class that contains one or more abstract methods, must also be declared as abstract.
// you can't create object of an abstract class            Animal a = new Animal(); // ❌ Error
// abstract Parent(){}: abstract constructor is not allowed
// abstract static method also not allowed because the word abstract is meant for overridden where the static method cannot be overridden, so abstract static is not allowed.
// but you can create static method in/inside the abstract class, only abstract static is not allowed which means using abstract keyword along with static.
